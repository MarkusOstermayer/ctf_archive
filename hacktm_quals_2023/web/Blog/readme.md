We made a new blogging website for everyone to use! It's pretty basic for now,
and it has a few limitations like:

1. No comments
2. Semi-working authentication system
3. Lots of random checks slowing down the entire website honestly (i don't know
what's going on so i'm not touching it)

To mitigate that, we made it such that only you can view your own posts. No one
can hack us now >:)

(im not sure what kind of blog that is tho...)
