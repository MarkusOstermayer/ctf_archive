# Description

After making my game, I found out about SIMD instructions in wasm to process zeros and ones even faster.

Note;
The Crypto.subtle API is only usable in a secure context (localhost or https), so the challenge can only be played locally.
If you think you've got the flag and it's not working, please create a ticket!
