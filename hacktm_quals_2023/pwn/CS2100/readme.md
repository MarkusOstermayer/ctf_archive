To all my CS2100 Computer Organisation students, I hope you've enjoyed the lectures thus far on RISC-V assembly.

I have set-up an online service for you to test your own RISC-V code!
Simply connect to the service through tcp:

nc 34.141.16.87 10000

Credit: Thanks to `@fmash16` for his emulator! I didn't even have to compile the emulator binary myself :O https://github.com/fmash16/riscv_emulator/blob/main/main
